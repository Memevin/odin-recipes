                    <li>Dried goji berries or frozen peas and carrots,for topping (optional)</li>
                    <li>Vegetable oil, for brushing</li>
                    <h4>For the sauce:</h4>
                    <li>1 tablespoon Asian chile paste</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons light soy sauce</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h4>Directions:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Make the filling: Peel the ginger by scraping it with a spoon, then grate 1 tablespoon. Stem and finely chop the mushrooms. Combine the ginger, mushrooms,scallion, pork, soy sauce, rice wine, sesame oil and cornstarch in a large bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Mix well with your hands until all of the ingredients are incorporated. </li>
                    <li>Form the dumplings: Place a damp paper towel over the wonton wrappers to keep them from drying out. Remove 1 wrapper and brush with some of the beaten egg.</li>
                    <li>Make a circle with your thumb and index finger; lay the wrapper on top, nudging it down to create a cup. Add 2 teaspoons filling, then pat the filling down with the back of a spoon.</li>
                    <li>Fold the overhanging wrapper edges down, leaving the filling exposed. Press the wrapper firmly around the filling. Pat the top and bottom of the dumpling to make it flat.</li>
                    <li>Top the dumpling with a dried goji berry or 1 each frozen pea and carrot. Repeat to form the remaining dumplings.</li>
                    <li>Steam the dumplings: Cut out a round of parchment paper to fit in a bamboo steamer and punch holes in the paper to let steam through. Line the steamer with the parchment and brush with vegetable oil; arrange the dumplings in the steamer and cover. Put the steamer in a wok or skillet with a few inches of boiling water, making sure the water does not touch the bottom of the steamer. Steam the dumplings 8 to 10 minutes, or until the pork is cooked through.</li>
                    <li>Make the sauce: Combine the chile paste and soy sauce in a small shallow bowl. Serve with the dumplings for dipping.</li>
                </ol>
